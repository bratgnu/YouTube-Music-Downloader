# YouTube-Music-Downloader
This tool allows to download individual songs or all songs from a playlist from YouTube as .mp3 files.

Before running, you need to update the file path in _helpfile.py_. You can also directly paste the path into _app.py_ and _app_playlist.py_, where it says _DOWNLOAD_FOLDER_.
